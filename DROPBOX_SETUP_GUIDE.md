## 🗂️ **WHAT GETS STORED IN DROPBOX**

Your Dropbox will automatically create this folder structure:
```
/Apps/bewellbe-data-sync/bewellbe-data/
├── staff-data.json                    # All staff accounts
├── inventory-data.json                # Inventory data (future)
└── conversation-backups/              # Chat conversation backups
    ├── conversation-1234567890.json
    ├── conversation-1234567891.json
    └── ...
```

---

## 🔄 **BACKUP FEATURES**

### Automatic Backups:
- **Staff data**: Syncs immediately when you add/edit/delete staff
- **Conversations**: Auto-backup every 5 minutes and every 10 messages
- **Inventory data**: Syncs when you make changes (future feature)

### Manual Backups:
- Look for the **"💾 Backup Conversation"** button on any page
- Click to manually save current conversation

---

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### ⚠️ "Dropbox setup required" message:
- Double-check your access token in Netlify
- Make sure you redeployed the site after adding the token
- Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to take effect

### ❌ "Connection error" message:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Dropbox token is still valid
- Try refreshing the page

### 🔄 "Using Netlify backup" message:
- Dropbox is temporarily unavailable but system still works
- Data will sync to Dropbox when connection is restored

## 💡 **PRO TIPS**

1. **Multiple Locations**: All Birmingham, UWM, and Berkeley staff can now use the same login system
2. **Device Independence**: Add staff on your computer, they can login on any device immediately
3. **Conversation Recovery**: If Claude crashes, your conversation backups are safe in Dropbox
4. **Security**: Your token is encrypted in Netlify - I never see your actual credentials

---

## 🎉 **YOU'RE DONE!**

Once you complete these steps:
- ✅ All staff you add will work across all devices immediately
- ✅ Conversations are automatically backed up to Dropbox
- ✅ Triple redundancy ensures you never lose data
- ✅ Real-time sync status keeps you informed

**Test it by adding yourself as a staff member in the admin dashboard, then logging in from a different browser!**

## 📞 **NEED HELP?**

If you run into issues:
1. Check the **connection status** messages in the admin dashboard
2. Verify all steps above were completed correctly
3. Try refreshing the page and waiting 2-3 minutes
4. The system has fallbacks, so it will work even if Dropbox is temporarily unavailable

**The paper-based inventory nightmare is officially over! 🎊**
