If you would like to come in earlier in the day or on Saturday to get your adjustment then, we can make that happen to compensate. Sorry for the long message!

            Hey! This is BeWell reaching out to let you know that we need a global referral!!

            This will allow us to bill your services through to your insurance and should change the current balance on your statement to a lower charge! Looking forward to seeing you soon :)<br><br>
            And please make sure the referral is dated back to your first visit or to when you started with that insurance - I can look it up for you if you would like!

            Unfortunately since we recently introduced the labs at the beginning of the year, it is not eligible for insurance, but we can take HSA and FSA cards for payment! The pricing can also range from $200-$1000 depending on how extensive of a test you would like - in the consultation, Silvio will make sure to go over all pricing with you for full transparency!

        <div class="template-box">
            <div class="template-title">Blood Lab Breakdown for Patients</div>
            No worries! And for our blood labs we have tons of different types - the way it would work consists of the following:<br><br>
            
            <strong>Step 1:</strong> We would send our BioSync paperwork over to you (this basically will tell us what you are interested in knowing, what you want to get tested, certain problems that may be happening etc)<br><br>
            
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> The doc will then look over everything once submitted, and see which areas are most important/prominent to be testing<br><br>
            
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the paperwork has been reviewed - we will have you come in and get a consultation with our Nurse (and Silvio), to make sure everyone is on the same page with what is being tested, and to go over any questions you may have<br><br>
            
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> We can then get you set up with the nurse (normally same day as consultation) so she can draw your blood<br><br>
            
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Once we send out the test, and get the results back, we will have you come in for a follow up appt to go over your results and findings<br><br>
            
            <strong>Step 6:</strong> After we get all of that out of the way, you can either choose to stop here or continue on to know more about our total transformation program, which will allow you to receive a full treatment plan, dietary restrictions and lists, recommended services/supplements, workout schedules and so much more!!
