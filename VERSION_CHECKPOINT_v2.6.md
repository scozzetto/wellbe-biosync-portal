  - Snooze functionality with dropdown options
  - Daily summary notifications
  - Missed notification queue system

- **Selective Printing**: Checkbox system for selecting specific tasks to print
- **Task Editing**: Click-to-edit functionality for all task properties
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Tasks saved locally with sample data for demo

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Print Select Button**: Moved from top-right corner to bottom action bar for cleaner layout

// Web Audio API implementation
function playBeep() {
    initAudio();
    const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
    const gainNode = audioContext.createGain();
    oscillator.frequency.value = 800; // 800Hz tone
    oscillator.type = 'sine';
    gainNode.gain.value = 0.3;
    oscillator.start();
    oscillator.stop(audioContext.currentTime + 0.2);
}
