            <strong style="color: #1a5963;">Message for 5pm/6pm massage patients on Fridays</strong><br>
            Hey (patient name) - I just wanted to reach out and let you know some things about your appointment tomorrow - we end chiro around 4:30 so we will not be here when 6pm comes around for your massage - we can however still bill it through your insurance per the inconvenience so you won't have to worry about payment. If you would like to come in earlier in the day or on Saturday to get your adjustment then, we can make that happen to compensate. Sorry for the long message!

            Hey! This is BeWell reaching out to let you know that we need a global referral!! This is so we are able to bill through your insurance - you can go to your primary care physician and let them know you need a global referral faxed to BeWell at 2487926574 or emailed to us at birmingham@bewelllifestylecenters.com<br><br>
            This will allow us to bill your services through to your insurance and should change the current balance on your statement to a lower charge! Looking forward to seeing you soon :)<br><br>
            and please make sure the referral is dated back to your first visit or to when you started with that insurance - I can look it up for you if you would like!

            <strong style="color: #1a5963;">Consultation text (peptide)</strong><br>
            I can get you booked for a peptide consultation and get the paperwork sent over to you as well! The consultation runs $50, the nurse and doc will be going over the paperwork with you, along with creating a treatment plan for you to follow!! Let me know what day would work best to get you on schedule!
        </div>

            <strong style="color: #1a5963;">Bloodlab/Insurance Answer</strong><br>
            Unfortunately since we recently introduced the labs at the beginning of the year, it is not eligible for insurance, but we can take HSA and FSA cards for payment! The pricing can also range from $200-$1000 depending on how extensive of a test you would like - in the consultation, Silvio will make sure to go over all pricing with you for full transparency!
        </div>

            <strong style="color: #1a5963;">Bloodlab Breakdown for Patients</strong><br>
            No worries! And for our bloodlabs we have tons of different types - the way it would work consists of the following:<br><br>
            - we would send our BioSync paperwork over to you (this basically will tell us what you are interested in knowing, what you what to get tested, certain problems that may be happening ect)<br><br>
            - the doc will then look over everything once submitted, and see which areas are most important/prominent to be testing<br><br>
            - once the paperwork has been reviewed - we will have you come in and get a consultation with our Nurse (and Silvio), to make sure everyone is on the same page with what is being tested, and to go over any questions you may have<br><br>
            - we can then get you set up with the nurse (normally same day as consultation) so she can draw your blood<br><br>
            - once we send out the test, and get the results back, we will have you come in for a follow up appt to go over your results and findings<br><br>
            - after we get all of that out of the way, you can either choose to stop here or continue on to know more about our total transformation program, which will allow to you receive a full treatment plan, dietary restrictions and lists, recommended services/supplements, workout schedules and so much more!!
